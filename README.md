# Diet_Recommender
I developed a dietary recommender system to suggest fast food menu items based on nutritional preferences. I used Python, SQLite and SQL.
I am a type1 Diabetic, and wanted to make a Python/SQL project that takes all fast food restuarants from the US, and filters the menus based on my carb and protein threshold.
I made sure the data was clean and ready for use, then imported it into Pythons using pandas and started developing the queries/code.
